Raid 5 and 6 are not recommended because of the extended stripe. If you encounter this question on the exam I suspect the answer options will be different. Raid 1 Disadvantage Does not provide a write performance improvement; requires more Amazon EC2 to Amazon EBS bandwidth than non- RAID configurations because the data is written to multiple volumes simultaneously. Raid 0 Disadvantage Performance of the stripe is limited to the worst performing volume in the set. Loss of a single volume results in a complete data loss for the array. Raid 5 and 6 notes RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for Amazon EBS because the parity write operations of these RAID modes consume some of the IOPS available to your volumes. Depending on the configuration of your RAID array, these RAID modes provide 20-30% fewer usable IOPS than a RAID 0 configuration. Increased cost is a factor with these RAID modes as well; when using identical volume sizes and speeds, a 2-volume RAID 0 array can outperform a 4-volume RAID 6 array that costs twice as much.   ' ),

(298, 'You have recently joined a startup company building sensors to measure street noise and air quality in urban areas. The company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data every minute to a backend hosted on AWS. During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per month in the database. The current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a PostgreSQL RDS database with 500GB standard storage. The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors. The business plan requires a deployment of at least 1O0K sensors which needs to be supported by the backend. You also need to store sensor data for at least two years to be able to compare year over year Improvements. To secure funding, you have to make sure that the platform meets these requirements and leaves room for further scaling.

Unlike the primary key on a table, a GSI index does not require the indexed attributes to be unique. Q: Are GSI key attributes required in all items of a DynamoDB table? No. GSIs are sparse indexes. Unlike the requirement of having a primary key, an item in a DynamoDB table does not have to contain any of the GSI keys. If a GSI key has both hash and range elements, and a table item omits either of them, then that item will not be indexed by the corresponding GSI. In such cases, a GSI can be very useful in efficiently locating items that have an uncommon attribute. ' )
